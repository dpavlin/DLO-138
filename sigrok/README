Create dump file using microcom:

microcom --logfile=ir-dump.4 -p /dev/ttyACM0

Press d to generate dump.

If you are not in auto mode, you might wait for trigger to generate data dump.

After dump scrolled on screen, press ctrl+\ and type quit to exit microcom.

Run conversion script on generated dump file:

./dump2sr.pl ir-dump.4 

This will create new.sr file (and new/ directory in which you can examine data)
and you can open it using pulseview:

pulseview new.sr

You might want to delete CH2 if you don't have hardware modification since it's noise.
